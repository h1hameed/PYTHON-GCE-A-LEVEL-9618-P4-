## 🚀 Algorithms Implemented
- **Abstract Data Types**
  - Stack (LIFO)
  - Queue (FIFO)
  - Linked List
  - Binary Tree (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder Traversals)
- **Searching**
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
- **Sorting**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- **OOP Examples**
  - Player class
  - Employee (Inheritance, super())

## ▶️ How to Run
Clone the repo and run any file:
```bash
python ADT/stack.py
python sorting/bubble_sort.py
```
